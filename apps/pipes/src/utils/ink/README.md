# ink

This is (ink)[https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink] without any interactivity. Using MobX reactivity and only CI output. It is unlikely that any changes here are useful to anyone excep this project.

You should probably use the original project instead. It is great. But you are free to do whatever. Kudos to the contributors to the original project. Sorry for the mess!
