/**
 * This module provides a set of TypeScript type definitions for managing "Modules" in a sophisticated system.
 *
 * A "Module" here is defined as an entity with a Name, a Definition, a Config, and a Context.
 * The Context itself is broken down into three parts: ContextInterface, OutsideInterface, and Implement.
 * Modules can have dependencies on other modules, which are classified as either RequiredModules or OptionalModules.
 *
 * There are numerous utility types defined in this module that aid in creating and managing these modules:
 * - MergeStateHelper: Helps merge module states based on string keys, and applies typing to determine the final state.
 * - MergeOutsideInterface: Merges the outside interfaces of modules.
 * - MergeConfig: Merges the configs of modules.
 *
 * FunctionKeys,
 * NonFunctionKeys,
 * ReplaceFunctionKeys,
 * ReplaceImplementation,
 * are utility types used for transforming the context,
 * specifically for changing functions and non-functions in the context and implementing them.
 *
 * The two main types that should be used directly by programmers are `createModule` and `newModuleName`:
 * - `createModule` is a type function that uses the utility types to define a complete "Module" type.
 *   It handles the merging of configurations and outside interfaces from
 *   required and optional modules, generates the final
 *   implementation, and forms the new context.
 * - `newModuleName` is used to enforce the naming scheme of modules.
 *
 * This module's extensive and complex TypeScript typings allow for
 * maintaining safety and consistency across your codebase,
 * especially when working with interdependent modules in a complex system.
